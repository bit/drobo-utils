Random useful bits for developers. 

Debugging:

   in Drobo.py 

   DEBUG = 1  --- makes things a lot more traceable.

   when reporting problems, debug listings can be useful, but only
   if the problem isn't reproducible elsewhere.
 
dpkg vs. python install:
   setup.py puts things in /usr/bin,  dpkg in /usr/sbin.  haven't reviewed 
   for other conflicts, least confusing to use one or the other method
   on a system.  (if you do python install, then dpkg --purge drobo-utils)

   There doesn't seem to be a distutils way to remove a package.



Building debian & ubuntu packages:

   (assumes you have installed the Build dependencies...)

   #obtain a fresh tree with no svn cruft...

   svn export https://drobo-utils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/drobo-utils/trunk
   mv trunk drobo-utils-0.3.3
   cd drobo-utils-0.3.3

   ln -s notdebian debian     # real debian packages use another debian/ tree.
   chmod 755 notdebian/rules  # I dunno why the permissions are wrong...

   vi notdebian/changelog     # review version tags for accuracy and consistency.
   vi Drobo.py                # /VERSION

   # this debian/ config is just for non-distro packages.
   # builds for debian and Ubuntu.

   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
   cd ..
   # rename it for whatever distro is appropriate...
   mv drobo_utils_0.3.3-1_i386 --> droboutils_0.3.3-1_i386_ubunutuIntrepid.deb

   # rebuild the source tar because it will have the 'debian' link in it.
   cd drobo-utils-0.99.9
   rm debian
   cd ..
   tar -czvf drobo-utils-0.3.3-1.tgz drobo-utils-0.99.9


QA Test checklist prior to release:

   1.1 drobom status... check for accuracy.
   1.2 drobom settime
   1.3 drobom status... check for accuracy.
   1.4 drobom fwload (something really old)
   1.5 drobom fwupgrade
   1.6 drobom fwupgrade (if needed.)
   1.7 drobom setlunsize 1,2,3  (should fail on 3)
   1.8 drobom create file systems, each type.
   
   ....
