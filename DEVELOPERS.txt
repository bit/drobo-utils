Random useful bits for developers.  (aka notes to myself ;-)

 
dpkg vs. python install:
   the dpkg stuff in notdebian puts stuff in /usr/sbin while setup.py puts things in /usr/bin.  
   python install does not install man pages either, which the dpkg takes care of.
   The libs are placed differently too.  haven't reviewed for other conflicts, least 
   confusing to use one or the other method on a system.  
   (if you do python install, then dpkg --purge drobo-utils)

   There doesn't seem to be a distutils way to remove a package.
   I just do an installation, then manually remove the files it puts it.


Making a release.

  1 - make a branch
   svn copy https://drobo-utils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/drobo-utils/trunk https://drobo-utils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/drobo-utils/branches/<branch>

  2 - Stamp the branch with version 
   vi notdebian/changelog     # review version tags for accuracy and consistency.
   vi Drobo.py                # edit VERSION

  3 - Build packages for testing & Install them. (see separate recipe.)

  4 - Run QA.
   typically make a branch for each release.  Record results of release tests in the branch (QA.txt)
   as new tests are created, modify QA.txt on trunk for to keep references for the next release.



Building debian & ubuntu packages:

   (assumes you have installed the Build dependencies...)

   #obtain a fresh tree with no svn cruft...
   to just build a package:
   svn export https://drobo-utils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/drobo-utils/branches/<version>

   mv trunk drobo-utils-<version>
   cd drobo-utils-<version>

   ln -s notdebian debian     # real debian packages use another debian/ tree.
   chmod 755 notdebian/rules  # I dunno why the permissions are wrong...


   # this debian/ config is just for non-distro packages.
   # builds for debian and Ubuntu.

   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
   cd ..
   # rename it for whatever distro is appropriate...
   mv drobo_utils_0.3.3-1_i386 --> droboutils_0.3.3-1_i386_ubunutuIntrepid.deb

   # rebuild the source tar because it will have the 'debian' link in it.
   cd drobo-utils-0.99.9
   rm debian
   cd ..
   tar -czvf drobo-utils-0.3.3-1.tgz drobo-utils-0.99.9

   apply QA tests. as per QA.txt recording results there.
