Drobo-Utils: Drobo: API, CLI, &amp; Dashboard for Linux
=======================================================

A Drobo_ is a cool little storage unit where you just put disks in, and it takes care
of figuring out how to protect you from data loss.  You do not, like other raids, have 
to install matching disks.  You do not, like other units, make arcane decisions about 
how the data is laid out.  It pretends to be just a pile of storage, and does the smart 
thing you would have done if you had taken the time to put your mind to it.

So you bought a Drobo_ and you want to use it under linux.  Great!  Plug it in and Go!  
Really! It can be used just as a normal disk.  Plug it in like any USB thumb drive.  
If you are an old Linux hand, then just use a partitioner, such as parted, 
and build an ext3 file system and set your mount point.  see the Setup_ section for 
details on manually setting things up from the command line without any special software.
For those with other tastes, there is also a GUI that can take care of it:

You can use Drobos without any special software.  The blue capacity lights will fill up as 
the disks fill.  When it gets too full, Drobo will ask for another drive with its drive 
lights. Just feed it drives when it asks, and you are good to go. So what is the 
dashboard good for?

 * If you cannot see your Drobo, it can tell you what the lights would tell you.
 * You can check if there is newer firmware available, and update it.
 * You can see information about the hard drives in the Drobo without taking them out.
 * You can change the drobo's settings from their defaults (like a 2 TiB LUN size)
 * If you are using a DroboPro, then there are many settings (ip address?) you might
   need in order to configure it properly for use.

So that is where drobo-utils, the linux dashboard, comes in.
