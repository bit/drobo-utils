drobo-utils (0.6.1) stable; urgency=low

  * DroboPro identification fix by spobole,
  * parted fix from Patrick Bills
  * Looked at newly released DMIP. Found option2 commands for settings.
  * Options2 query/set implemented (but cannot test for DroboPRO)
  * migrated source code managers from subversion to git
  * minor: consistency of default location to look for fw between lib and gui.
  * fixed that inability to read lun size on old firmwares crashed GUI.
    GUI now works all the way back to the beginning.

drobo-utils (0.5.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * replaced DroboDMP C extension by DroboIOctl python class.  no need
    for architecture dependent packages. this also means you can just 
    try it out straight after download, no need to install anything.
    much easier. fewer build dependencies as well.
  * device detection completely re-written.  It works better now.
  * Now displays mount points where it makes sense to do so.
  * status command output better/different. shows all devices and mount points
    for each drobo.
  * full Multiple LUN support.    should do what is expected.
  * full multiple Drobo support.  should do what is expected.
  * added modular info printing with csv list of outputs.
  * firmware 1.3.0, has enabled formerly broken functionality which
    name makes the sync command rename every drobo to 'hi there'.
    fixed.
  * added 'name' command, to name Drobo. (functionality of Sync)
  * corrected detection logic, which depended on formerly immutable name. 
    (affects fw >= 1.3.0) now use same mechanisms as sg_scan from sg3_utils.
  * documentation moved into restructured text. now shows up on the web.
    web site and documntation now consistent.

drobo-utils (0.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * IMPORTANT: firmware 1.3.0 support added.  Earlier drobo-utils versions
    will not recognize a drobo running 1.3.0 or later.
  * CLI is more normal...  use getopts (got rid of device as fixed place arg.)
    now allows command to be an option as well.
  * Changed DEBUG from a flag requiring code modification, to a bitmap honored
    as a command-line argument (--verbose)
  * misc. improvements in documentation.
  * droboview now only launches for first drobo found in list, and stays
    foreground always.
  * drobom list returns a list that is easier to parse (suitable for use in
    backticks.)
