Description: manage data robotics storage units (drobos)
 Provides utilities for managing Data Robotics storage units, also known as
 "Drobos".  Drobos are external hard drive enclosures that connect to your PC
 via USB or Firewire and provide RAID-like features.  Drobos provide automatic
 data redundancy, hotswappable drive bays, and the size of the RAID can be
 easily expanded.  Different sized hard drives can be mixed on the same Drobo.
 See http://drobo.com for more information.
 .
 This package provides a command line interface for managing a Drobo, as well
 as a graphical dashboard interface.  To enable the graphical interface, please
 be sure to install the suggested python-qt4 package, as well as gparted.
