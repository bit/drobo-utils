need partitions?
If you are going to use your Drobo as a single file system, can't you just mke2fs
on the device file for the whole disk and skip partitioning altogether?

Can you mix and match file systems ?

answer from DRI person:
Yes, you can have multiple partitions per LUN.

If the host is not telling us the capacity it sees, then the Drobo firmware uses its own capacity calculation, which is roughly number of used clusters divided by the total possible clusters (calculated by excluding metadata space from the calculation), so it should be FS agnostic.

We can scavenge from different FSes, but only those we understand: NTFS, FAT, HFS(+) and Ext3/2.
