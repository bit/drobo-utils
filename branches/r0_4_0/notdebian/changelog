drobo-utils (0.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * IMPORTANT: firmware 1.3.0 support added.  Earlier drobo-utils
     versions will not recognize a drobo running 1.3.0 or later.
  * CLI is more normal...  use getopts (got rid of device as fixed place
arg.)
     now allows command to be an option as well.
  * Changed DEBUG from a flag requiring code modification, to a bitmap
     honored as a command-line argument (--verbose)
  * misc. improvements in documentation.
  * droboview now only launches for first drobo found in list, and stays
foreground
     always.
  * drobom list returns a list that is easier to parse (suitable for use in
backticks.)
