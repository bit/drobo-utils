Testing standard....

	-- build FS.
	-- install oldest fw.
	-- format FAT32.
	-- roll forward from there.

STANDARD menu entries for droboview...

MULTIPLE LUN support:
  ON multiple Drobos with a single LUN:
        That is the assumed case.  In that case, when you invoke ./droboview,
        it will start up one GUI per Drobo.

  ON MULTIPLE LUNS on a single Drobo:
        Currently it will start up one GUI per LUN, which will get confusing.

        DonÂ´t know how to tell when two ways to get at a single drobo are
        the same one.  Serial number?

        cannot test this configuration.  anyone want to send me a couple
        of terabytes?


Better STATUS progress reporting:
   -- the block count is there, but heuristics for determining timing suck.
   -- some sort of indicator of how long 'relay out' will be in progress.
   -- when it is busy, it should say so... like when I emptied an
      ntfs it took hours for the led indicators to drop from 70% to 0.
      It should say something about what is going on.


Documentation Dialogs:
   -- need a blame/credit window.
   -- maybe a help window.


LIVELIER GUI:
   -- have status queries proceed asynchronously from the GUI.
      right now, if the drobo is slow, the GUI makes it slower, and gets very slow too.
      should run as a daemon, async. from the GUI.

Re-design the whole darn thing.
   -- there should be some sort of service integrated with dbus-hal
   -- not sure that a GUI is needed at all. but if it is, it should be a DBUS client.
   -- how does authentication work in DBUS?


   of interest:
   -- python bindings for parted... http://dcantrel.fedorapeople.org/pyparted/


use ctypes to replace the C stub...
