TODO:
   -- dialog for formatting.
        -- labels for max lun size slider... which is strange... shouldn't that
           be in the format thing? seems kind a dangerous to do without formatting.
        -- slider not updated from drobo, so number is always 2.

   stuff I would like:
   -- some sort of indicator of how long 'relay out' will be in progress.
      and when it is busy, it should say so... like when I emptied an
      ntfs it took hours for the led indicators to drop from 70% to 0.
   -- should this be integrated with dbus somehow ? dunno...
   -- awaiting hints from drobo.com about how to 'do' stuff...
		format, set lun size.

   -- have status queries proceed asynchronously from the GUI.
      right now, if the drobo is slow, the GUI makes it slower, and gets very slow too.
      should run as a daemon, async. from the GUI.

   of interest:
   -- python bindings for parted... http://dcantrel.fedorapeople.org/pyparted/
