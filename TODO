FIRMWARE UPGRADE:
   -- where do I get firmware from?
   -- how to test without bricking my Drobo?
   -- how do I resuscitate if I brick it?


SYNC
   -- mode select ...
      It is a ModeSelect using the SystemInfo page.

      Send the following:

      Standard 4-byte subpage header, followed by:

            uint32  currentTime; ///< Current time (in # of seconds since Jan 1, 1970)

            int16   GMTOffset;   ///< GMT offset
            char    name[32];  /// -unused, but best to set ...

      the systemInfo read page is hard coded to return 2048 as the time zone, which
      is obviously wrong, so treating it as a single byte.  apparently hard coded in
      firmware as of 1.1.1. (source: drobo/rsharpe)

Remember, everything is in network byte order (well, almost J

MULTIPLE LUN support:
  ON multiple Drobos with a single LUN:
        That is the assumed case.  In that case, when you invoke ./droboview,
        it will start up one GUI per Drobo.

  ON MULTIPLE LUNS on a single Drobo:
        Currently it will start up one GUI per LUN, which will get confusing.

        DonÂ´t know how to tell when two ways to get at a single drobo are
        the same one.  Serial number?

        cannot test this configuration.  anyone want to send me a couple
        of terabytes?




FORMAT
   -- dialog for formatting.
        -- labels for max lun size slider... which is strange... shouldn't that
           be in the format thing? seems kind a dangerous to do without formatting.
        -- slider not updated from drobo, so number is always 2.
   -- awaiting hints from drobo.com about how to 'do' stuff...
		format, set lun size.
      maybe it's already there... dunno...

Better STATUS progress reporting:
   -- some sort of indicator of how long 'relay out' will be in progress.
   -- when it is busy, it should say so... like when I emptied an
      ntfs it took hours for the led indicators to drop from 70% to 0.
      It should say something about what is going on.


LIVELIER GUI:
   -- have status queries proceed asynchronously from the GUI.
      right now, if the drobo is slow, the GUI makes it slower, and gets very slow too.
      should run as a daemon, async. from the GUI.

Better Linux Integration:
   -- should this be integrated with dbus somehow ? dunno...

   of interest:
   -- python bindings for parted... http://dcantrel.fedorapeople.org/pyparted/
