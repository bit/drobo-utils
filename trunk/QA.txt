   1.2 drobom settime

   1.4 drobom fwload (something really old)
     1.4.1 drobom shutdown -- to run the firmware.
     1.4.2 hard reset to factory default 
        after downgrade, disk pack will no longer be recognized. need to reset to make Drobo
        look at the disks.
        (with the pin in the back and all that.)
     1.4.3 place a file on the Drobo. make sure it works.
     1.4.4 drobom status -- have a look.
   
   1.5 drobom fwupgrade
     1.5.1 drobom shutdown - to run the firmware.

     1.5.3 repeat 1.5 perhaps a second time (as needed to get to current)
