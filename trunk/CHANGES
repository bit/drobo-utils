0.4.1
  * Multiple LUN detection now done properly, should work better 
    with multiple LUNS and multiple Drobos.  new dependency: sg3-utils 
  * added modular info printing with csv list of outputs.


0.4.0 
  * IMPORTANT: firmware 1.3.0 support added.  Earlier drobo-utils 
     versions will not recognize a drobo running 1.3.0 or later.
  * CLI is more normal...  use getopts (got rid of device as fixed place arg.)
     now allows command to be an option as well.  
  * Changed DEBUG from a flag requiring code modification, to a bitmap
     honored as a command-line argument (--verbose)
  * misc. improvements in documentation.
  * droboview now only launches for first drobo found in list, and stays foreground
     always.
  * drobom list returns a list that is easier to parse (suitable for use in backticks.)
  * droboview is now just a stub for drobom view. reduced overhead.
  * now reports VERSION id in usage.  There is a -V option too.


0.3.3 release: 2008/11/05

  * more messaging fixups for when you don't invoke as root.
  * fix for ubuntu Intrepid deciding all disks are Drobos. !!
  * fixed all the firmware info parsing issues.
  * firmware load issues should all be gone.
  * Brad's fix for ddiag.c, done properly this time (my bad!)

0.3.2

  * for v1, still don't understand index.txt file.
  * after testing, some more fixes, v2 downloads now work.
  * fixes received from Brad Guillory for v2/tdz firmware downloading.
     they don't do any harm afaict, don't have a v2 to test with.
  * added fwload directive to drobom.
  * added root user check to give a bigger hint.

0.3.1

  * OK I know checking for firmware updates doesn't work
     right now, but I need to find out why.  code seems correct.
     there is a bugfix for getting rid of the 'licensed' part.

  * fixes for firmware validation:
       * header CRC on 32bit was broken on 64bit.
       * 32 vs. 64 bit kludge needed.

0.3.0
  * added ability to format Drobo
  * added ability to set lun sizes
  * bugfix for firmware:
        * CRC32 on 32bit intel. (use signed, instead of unsigned.)
        * fixed header CRC not validating.
  * added ability to set time on Drobo.
  * added simulation mode to Drobo.py, development aid.
  * some work done towards lunsize setting, but incomplete.
  * some work towards indicating relay out progress, not tested...
