 python gui, cli, and api providing the "Dashboard" functionality.
 If you fire up droboview, it should look pretty familiar to those who
 have seen the dashboard on other operating systems.  Droboview is built
 on a little programmer interface which can be installed on the system
 and used by other applications as well.  For experienced Linux hands,
 there is a command line interface, drobom, which offers the same
 functionality as droboview.
