	python setup.py build

Then you can  kick the tires by starting it up with: 

	./droboview

haven't worked out how to install it correctly yet.

gparted failed and seems to have a 2 TB limit on devices.
It's just the GUI, libparted is fine, and other tools based on it
still work, one can created a label with:

(assuming the disk is /dev/sdd)

parted /dev/sdd mklabel gpt

and use gnu-fdisk to create the partition.  

From the Doboshare forums, building a file system:

mke2fs –j –i 262144 –L Drobo01 -m 0 –O sparse_super,^resize_inode  /dev/sdd1

MANIFEST:

Pieces:
  droboview   - GUI 
  drobodump   - CLI script, accesses Drobo.py with no GUI stuff.
  DroboGUI.py - implements GUI. uses Drobo.py for Drobo related stuff.
  Drobo.py   -- overall Drobo io manager, provides API & "python CLI"
                uses DroboDMP.c to do raw io.
  DroboDMP.c -- python module to perform the detailed drobo ioctls.
                only platform specific stuff is in here...
  setup.py --   python version of a Makefile


deps:     - packages needed to run the package (assuming already built elsewhere.)
  python
  python-qt
  gtksudo or kdesudo - searches on startup for one or the other.
           if neither are around, then get a graphical sudo of you choice
	   and add it to the search list at the end of DroboGUI.__init__ 

   
build-deps:   - packages needed to build the package.
  libsgutils1-dev -- ioctl support.
  python-dev      -- to build DroboDMP extension.


Notes:
   droboview isn't suited to run continuously for long periods, 
   as it has a memory leak...  total foot print starts out at 32M
   with a 14 MB resident set size, of which 10 MB are shared, so only 
   about 4M of real memory consumed.   RSS grows at about 2MB/hour.

   best to restart it daily, or use it when necessary, but not leave it
   on for days.
