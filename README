WHAT IS THIS?

Drobo-utils is a set of linux tools to query and manage Data Robotics
Drobo storage systems.   If you fire up droboview, it should look pretty
familiar to those who have seen the dashboard on other operating systems. 
Droboview is built on a little programmer interface which can be installed 
on the system and used by other applications as well.

For experienced Linux hands, there is a command line interface, drobom,
which offers the same functionality as droboview.


COMPONENTS:

  droboview   - Graphical User interface to see how the Drobo is doing.
                this is a bit like the ´dashboard´ app for other OS´s.
  drobom      - CLI script, accesses Drobo.py with no GUI stuff.
  DroboGUI.py - implements GUI. uses Drobo.py for Drobo related stuff.
  Drobo.py   -- overall Drobo io manager, provides API & "python CLI"
                uses DroboDMP.c to do raw io.
  DroboDMP.c -- python module to perform the detailed drobo ioctls.
                only platform specific stuff is in here...
  setup.py --   python version of a Makefile

REQUIREMENTS:

drobo-utils was developed on pre-release version of Kubuntu Hardy Heron.
Any similarly recent distro ought to do.

To get drobo-utils running, you need packages something like (these are
ubuntu packages, names may vary on other distros):

essential:
  python      -- interpreter for python language
  python-qt4  -- python-qt4... This is actually a new version only in 
                              the newest distros.
  libsgutils1-dev -- ioctl support.
  python-dev      -- to build DroboDMP extension.

options:
  gtksudo or kdesudo - searches on startup for one or the other.
           if neither are around, then get a graphical sudo of you choice
	   and add it to the search list at the end of DroboGUI.__init__ 
  parted   for >= 2TB file systems, need GPT support.
           just use fdisk  for smaller stuff.

INSTALLING pre-requisites.:  
On ubuntu, it would typically look like so:

	open a shell window. they enter the following package installation commands:

	% sudo aptitude install python-qt4 libsgutils1-dev libsgutils1 python-dev  
	% sudo aptitude install parted kdesudo

On redhat/fedora distros, it would more likely be 'yum' instead of 'aptitude' and
some of the package names will change.



INSTALL:
Assuming you have all of the above parts, you should be able to just do:

	python setup.py build

which on my system looks like this:
alu% python ./setup.py build
running build
running build_py
creating build
creating build/lib.linux-i686-2.5
copying Drobo.py -> build/lib.linux-i686-2.5
copying DroboGUI.py -> build/lib.linux-i686-2.5
running build_ext

gcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -I/usr/include/python2.5 -c DroboDMP.c -o build/temp.linux-i686-2.5/DroboDMP.o
gcc -pthread -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions build/temp.linux-i686-2.5/DroboDMP.o -o build/lib.linux-i686-2.5/DroboDMP.so

changing mode of build/scripts-2.5/droboview from 644 to 755
alu%   

It should create a build/lib<somthing> sub-directory.  It will also
compile DroboDMP.c a put the result in a shared object object library 
in that directory.  If all has gone well, you can kick the tires 
by starting it up with: 
         
        ./drobom status 

see if something sensible happens... on my system with a drobo
the following happens:

% ./drobom status
/dev/sdd 100% full - ['Red alert', 'Bad disk', 'No redundancy']
%
very scary, but my drobo is in bad shape right now... you should just get []
as a status, which means there is nothing wrong.

To get all kinds of information on your drobo, try './drobom dump'
Once that is working, and assuming you have python-qt4 installed, try:

	./droboview

which should start a GUI for each drobo attached to your machine, that
you have permission to access (depends on the setup, usually USB devices 
on desktops are accessible to users, so you can see them.  Servers might be setup 
haven't worked out how to install it correctly yet.


Setup Drobo with Linux:

There is no functionality in the UI´s or API to partition or build
file systems on the Drobo.  Just use the system tools...

Drobos with firmware 1.1.1 or later work fine under linux with ext3.
You can, of course set up an NTFS or HPS+ or FAT32 if you really want,
but it seems actively counter-intuitive on Linux.  Have not tested
HPS, but ntfs-3g worked fine initially.  However, unless you are
going to physically move the disk to between systems, the native (ext3) 
format has many advantages.  The ´coffee is hot´ disclaimer is 
necessary at this point:

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING 4 LINES WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON YOUR DROBO!
WARNING: NO, IT WILL NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS!
WARNING: ASK YOURSELF, before you start: ARE YOU SURE? 
WARNING: AFTER THE SECOND LINE, YOU ARE TOAST.
WARNING: BEST TO BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFOREHAND...

Here is what you have to type:
parted -i /dev/sdd 
mklabel gpt
mkpart ext2 0 100%
quit

The above sets up the drobo as one big partition, with a label that says
it ought to contain an ext2 file system.  If you want an NTFS file system,
then write ´ntfs´ in place of ext2.  The next step is to add the file
system into the partition.  while the above step was instantaneous, the step 
below takes a while, just have a little patience, it´ll be fine.

From the Doboshare forums, building a file system:

mke2fs –j –i 262144 –L Drobo01 -m 0 –O sparse_super,^resize_inode  /dev/sdd1

(If you want an ntfs file system, then mkntfs -f -L Drobo01 /dev/sdd1 
ought to work too... )
On my system the process looked like this:

NOTE:

This is completely untested with multiple LUNS.  Best to make LUN
large enough to span all your space.

ON LUNSIZES >= 2TB:
 -- On older distributions, there are a couple of gotchas related to 
    linux tools which aren't 2TB ready...  to exceed 2 TB, you need to:
    	-- use GPT partitions, which aren´t supported by older fdisk
	   versions.  Tools based on libparted work fine, mostly.
    
        -- gparted fails, and seems to have a 2 TB limit on devices.
           (bug #524948 reported to bugzilla.gnome.org) It's just the GUI, 
           as libparted is fine, and other tools based on it
           still work. One can created a label with:

(assuming the disk is /dev/sdd)



Caveats:
   droboview isn't suited to run continuously for long periods, 
   as it has a memory leak...  total foot print starts out at 32M
   with a 14 MB resident set size, of which 10 MB are shared, so only 
   about 4M of real memory consumed.   but the RSS grows at about 
   2MB/hour.

   best to restart it daily, or use it when necessary, but not leave it
   on for days.

   sadly, firmware update isn´t in there yet.
